<p>As the countdown begins, my heart races with every number, because this isn’t just a gift — it’s a little piece of my love wrapped just for you.</p>
        <p>With each second, I think about your smile, your laugh, and the way you make ordinary moments feel magical. </p>
        <p>Ten reminds me of the countless dreams we’ll chase together, nine of the reasons I fall for you more each day, eight of the hugs that make everything better,</p>
        <p>Seven of the promises we’ll keep, six of the memories already close to my heart, five of the ways you inspire me, four of the seasons I want to spend by your side,</p>
        <p>Three simple words I feel every day, two hearts beating in sync, and one beautiful love that I treasure more than anything. </p>
        <p>This Valentine’s gift is just a small surprise compared to the endless love I have for you — but I hope when you open it, you feel every bit of that love wrapped inside. 💕</p>
